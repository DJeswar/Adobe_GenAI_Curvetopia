# Adobe_GenAI_Curvetopia
Curvetopia is a project focused on identifying, regularizing, and beautifying 2D curves in Euclidean space. The project transforms hand-drawn line art from polyline representations into smoothly connected cubic Bezier curves. The key challenges addressed include curve regularization, symmetry identification, and curve completion.
